## Notes

- Spent two hours trying to figure out why the recycler view took an entire page per item. Realized I forgot to put "wrap_content" instead of "match_parent".
- Customization feature was supposed to make it look like Amazon's UI. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at design.
- Making the button fit was a bit hacky. -4dp margins
